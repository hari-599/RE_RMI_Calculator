A web-based decision support system designed to calculate the **Regional Maturity Index (RMI)** for Renewable Energy projects. This tool digitizes a proprietary mathematical model provided by the client, allowing stakeholders to assess the readiness of different regions for energy infrastructure investments.

> **Note:** The underlying mathematical index and scoring logic were developed by the client. My role was to engineer the web architecture, data processing layer, and user interface to operationalize this model.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Digitized Assessment Model:** Transformed complex theoretical frameworks into a functional Python-based calculation engine.
* **Weighted Scoring System:** Implements dynamic variable processing (e.g., Policy Readiness, Grid Infrastructure, Economic Indicators) to generate a composite Maturity Score.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Built a clean, responsive UI for researchers to input regional data and visualize maturity gradients.
* **Cloud-Native:** Deployed on **Render** to ensure global accessibility for the client's research team.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Backend Logic:** Python, Flask
* **Data Processing:** Pandas (for weighted index calculations)
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Jinja2
* **Deployment:** Docker, Render
